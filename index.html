    <h1>Keiyon Tyler</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Keiyon Tyler and I will be talking
        a little bit about myself.  I am originally from North Carolina
        but I have lived in Virginia most of my life. I have a Bachelors in 
        Business Administration but want to work towards a Computer Science degree.
        I served in the Navy as an Information Systems Technician from December 2019 to July 2024. 
        I got married to my beautiful wife last year and we welcomed a son earlier this year.
        My hobbies include hanging out with my family, playing video games, and working out.
        I am passionate about computers and technology and I am hoping to learn a lot in this
        class to pursue a new career path.
