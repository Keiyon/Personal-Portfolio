    <h2>Biography</h2>
<!-- I have included a summary in the first paragraph, which is listed as <p> -->   
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Keiyon Tyler and I will be talking
           a little bit about myself.  I am originally from North Carolina
           but I have lived in Virginia most of my life. I have a Bachelors in 
           Business Administration but want to work towards a Computer Science degree.
           I served in the Navy as an Information Systems Technician from December 2019 to July 2024. 
           I got married to my beautiful wife last year and we welcomed a son earlier this year.
           My hobbies include hanging out with my family, playing video games, and working out.
           I am passionate about computers and technology and I am hoping to learn a lot in this
           class to pursue a new career path.           
        </p>
